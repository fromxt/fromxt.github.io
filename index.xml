You can play Wordle online, either on a computer or mobile device, right here.
Start by inputting a five-letter word and hitting enter.
The letters will then either turn green, yellow or stay blank.
Here’s what those colours mean:
Green – you have put the right letter in the right spot
Yellow – the letter is in the word, but in a different spot
Blank – the letter is not in the word You can use your previous guesses to inform you next guess, and attempt to guess the word within six attempts.</description></item><item><title>Happy New Year 2022</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/hapy_new_year_2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/hapy_new_year_2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/canicula/ImgURL/2022.jpg" alt="avatar">&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to write proxy PAC file</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/how_to_write_pac_file/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2021 14:34:30 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/how_to_write_pac_file/</guid><description>Overview Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) is a method used by Web browsers to select a proxy for a given URL. The method for choosing a proxy is written as a JavaScript function contained in a PAC file. This file can be hosted locally or on a network. Browsers can be configured to use the file manually.
How PAC Files Work Direct all traffic through the first proxy. If it is unreachable, use the second proxy.</description></item><item><title>Alternatives to Firefox Send</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/alternatives_to_firefox_send/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2020 15:34:30 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/alternatives_to_firefox_send/</guid><description>&lt;p>As many of you have probably seen, Firefox launched their encrypted file sharing system, However the service is discontinued right now, I&amp;rsquo;ll share your curated sharing tools which have a client-side encryption feature.You can find a similar service hosted by structures in which we have trust by going to the following sites:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How does Http and Https proxies work</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/http-https-proxy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2020 13:34:29 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/http-https-proxy/</guid><description>HTTP proxy gets a plain-text request and [in most but not all cases] sends a different HTTP request to the remote server, then returns information to the client. The specific flow of the HTTP proxy server is as follows. HTTPS proxy is a relayer, which receives special HTTP request (CONNECT verb) and builds an opaque tunnel to the destination server (which is not necessarily even an HTTPS server). Then the client sends SSL/TLS request to the server and they continue with SSL handshake and then with HTTPS (if requested).</description></item><item><title>Why Is 2020 Called a Leap Year?</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/why_2020_is_called_a_leap_year/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/why_2020_is_called_a_leap_year/</guid><description>Today we are talking about the somewhat unusual day of February 29.

To remove a ball, you must jump over it with another one. A valid move is to jump a peg over an adjacent peg into a hole two positions away and then to remove the jumped peg. Only vertical or horizontal movement is allowed in most board types. Diagonal movement is allowed only in the Triagular board. This may sound easy, but without a good strategy, you will get stuck sooner or later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>QR Code Generator</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/qr_code_generator/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2019 17:35:20 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/qr_code_generator/</guid><description>&lt;p>I just use &lt;a href="https://github.com/neocotic/qrious">qrious.js&lt;/a> to implement a simple QR code generator.Please feel free to try online QR code generator to make your own QR codes.

It began life as the so-called HTTP/0.9 protocol in 1991, and by 1999 had evolved to HTTP/1.1, which was standardised within the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). HTTP/1.1 was good enough for a long time but the ever changing needs of the Web called for a better suited protocol, and HTTP/2 emerged in 2015. More recently it was announced that the IETF is intending to deliver a new version - HTTP/3. To some people this is a surprise and has caused a bit of confusion. If you don&amp;rsquo;t track IETF work closely it might seem that HTTP/3 has come out of the blue. However, we can trace its origins through a lineage of experiments and evolution of Web protocols; specifically the QUIC transport protocol.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Happy New Year Everyone!💖</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/happy_new_year_2019/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/happy_new_year_2019/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/canicula/ImgURL/happy-2019-year.jpg" alt="avatar">&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>IPSec Modes: Transport and Tunnel</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/ipsec_modes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/ipsec_modes/</guid><description>&lt;p>IPSec modes are closely related to the function of the two core protocols, the Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). Both of these protocols provide protection by adding to a datagram a header (and possibly other fields) containing security information. The choice of mode does not affect the method by which each generates its header, but rather, changes what specific parts of the IP datagram are protected and how the headers are arranged to accomplish this. In essence, the mode really describes, not prescribes how AH or ESP do their thing. It is used as the basis for defining other constructs, such as security associations (SAs).&lt;/p>

A wide variety of sites offer text-only versions that work on any computer , but they’re occasionally buried and hard to find on the modern web.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are more than a few reasons to want to know where these sites are, however. Maybe you don’t like clutter? Maybe you’re one of the millions still using dial-up, and want a low-bandwidth way to read news? Maybe you regularly tether your computer to your smartphone, but don’t have an unlimited data plan? Maybe you like to read the news on your e-reader and want clean sites for doing so?

&lt;p>Whatever your reason, find a list of links to mobile news sites that work on any computer below, without the need for tricks like user agent switchers.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
