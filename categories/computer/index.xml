First, it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to update Redmi Note 4X with the latest version &lt;a href="https://xiaomirom.com/en/rom/redmi-note-4-mido-global-fastboot-recovery-rom/">V11.0.2.0.NCFMIXM&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to write proxy PAC file</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/how_to_write_pac_file/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2021 14:34:30 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/how_to_write_pac_file/</guid><description>Overview Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) is a method used by Web browsers to select a proxy for a given URL. The method for choosing a proxy is written as a JavaScript function contained in a PAC file. This file can be hosted locally or on a network. Browsers can be configured to use the file manually.
How PAC Files Work Direct all traffic through the first proxy. If it is unreachable, use the second proxy.</description></item><item><title>How does Http and Https proxies work</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/http-https-proxy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2020 13:34:29 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/http-https-proxy/</guid><description>HTTP proxy gets a plain-text request and [in most but not all cases] sends a different HTTP request to the remote server, then returns information to the client. The specific flow of the HTTP proxy server is as follows. HTTPS proxy is a relayer, which receives special HTTP request (CONNECT verb) and builds an opaque tunnel to the destination server (which is not necessarily even an HTTPS server). Then the client sends SSL/TLS request to the server and they continue with SSL handshake and then with HTTPS (if requested).</description></item><item><title>YDJSY：get started -2nd Practice</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/youdontknowjsyet2_practice_1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/youdontknowjsyet2_practice_1/</guid><description>After finish the Get Started study, I try to do some exercises to acquire a better understanding.

&lt;p>gopher n. 1. Any of various short tailed, burrowing mammals of the family Geomyidae, of North America. 2. (Amer. colloq.) Native or inhabitant of Minnesota: the Gopher State. 3. (Amer. colloq.) One who runs errands, does odd-jobs, fetches or delivers documents for office staff. 4. (computer tech.) software following a simple protocol for burrowing through a TCP/IP internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Gopher is a protocol for fetching information that dates back to 1993. It&amp;rsquo;s often regarded as a predecessor of sorts to the HTTP protocol that serves as the backbone of the Web as we know it today, however its simplicity and structure gives it a lot of worth.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>RESTful API Basic</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/restful_api/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/restful_api/</guid><description>&lt;p>REST (RESTful) API — stands for representational state transfer and runs mostly on the programming language JSON.

It began life as the so-called HTTP/0.9 protocol in 1991, and by 1999 had evolved to HTTP/1.1, which was standardised within the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). HTTP/1.1 was good enough for a long time but the ever changing needs of the Web called for a better suited protocol, and HTTP/2 emerged in 2015. More recently it was announced that the IETF is intending to deliver a new version - HTTP/3. To some people this is a surprise and has caused a bit of confusion. If you don&amp;rsquo;t track IETF work closely it might seem that HTTP/3 has come out of the blue. However, we can trace its origins through a lineage of experiments and evolution of Web protocols; specifically the QUIC transport protocol.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>IPSec Modes: Transport and Tunnel</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/ipsec_modes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/ipsec_modes/</guid><description>&lt;p>IPSec modes are closely related to the function of the two core protocols, the Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). Both of these protocols provide protection by adding to a datagram a header (and possibly other fields) containing security information. The choice of mode does not affect the method by which each generates its header, but rather, changes what specific parts of the IP datagram are protected and how the headers are arranged to accomplish this. In essence, the mode really describes, not prescribes how AH or ESP do their thing. It is used as the basis for defining other constructs, such as security associations (SAs).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s take a look at how the two modes work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Install Mercury's MW150UH/300UH WiFi USB Adapter driver on Unbunt 18.04</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/install_mercury_driver_ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Sep 2018 13:41:59 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/install_mercury_driver_ubuntu/</guid><description>&lt;p>The MW150UH/MW300UH 11N Wireless USB Adapters auto-sensing capability allows high packet transfer rateof up to 150Mbps/300Mbps for maximum throughput.
