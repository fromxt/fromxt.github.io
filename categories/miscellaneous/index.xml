You can play Wordle online, either on a computer or mobile device, right here.
Start by inputting a five-letter word and hitting enter.
The letters will then either turn green, yellow or stay blank.
Here’s what those colours mean:
Green – you have put the right letter in the right spot
Yellow – the letter is in the word, but in a different spot
Blank – the letter is not in the word You can use your previous guesses to inform you next guess, and attempt to guess the word within six attempts.</description></item><item><title>Happy New Year 2022</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/hapy_new_year_2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/hapy_new_year_2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/canicula/ImgURL/2022.jpg" alt="avatar">&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Alternatives to Firefox Send</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/alternatives_to_firefox_send/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2020 15:34:30 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/alternatives_to_firefox_send/</guid><description>&lt;p>As many of you have probably seen, Firefox launched their encrypted file sharing system, However the service is discontinued right now, I&amp;rsquo;ll share your curated sharing tools which have a client-side encryption feature.You can find a similar service hosted by structures in which we have trust by going to the following sites:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Is 2020 Called a Leap Year?</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/why_2020_is_called_a_leap_year/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/why_2020_is_called_a_leap_year/</guid><description>Today we are talking about the somewhat unusual day of February 29. It comes up on the calendar only every four years. A year with a February 29 might be good news if you are paid by the day or the week. But it might be bad news if you were born on a February 29. You have to wait three years in between birthdays.
In any case, American English has a term for the unusual situation.</description></item><item><title>An special day 20200202</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/palindrome_day/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/palindrome_day/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today is a most-glorious, super rare palindrome day.What makes this palindrome day so rare is that it works globally – as in, for Americans who write &lt;code>MMDDYYYY&lt;/code>, as well as for other places that write &lt;code>DDMMYYYY&lt;/code>, including countries like Brazil, Egypt, Germany, India, Italy, United Kingdom, etc. It also works for &lt;code>YYYYMMDD&lt;/code>，which is popular in Canada, China, Japan, Lithuania, etc.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>HAPPY NEW YEAR 2020!</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/hapy_new_year_2020/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/hapy_new_year_2020/</guid><description>&lt;p>May your dreams and wishes come true!

To remove a ball, you must jump over it with another one. A valid move is to jump a peg over an adjacent peg into a hole two positions away and then to remove the jumped peg. Only vertical or horizontal movement is allowed in most board types. Diagonal movement is allowed only in the Triagular board. This may sound easy, but without a good strategy, you will get stuck sooner or later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>QR Code Generator</title><link>https://fromxt.github.io/post/qr_code_generator/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2019 17:35:20 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://fromxt.github.io/post/qr_code_generator/</guid><description>&lt;p>I just use &lt;a href="https://github.com/neocotic/qrious">qrious.js&lt;/a> to implement a simple QR code generator.Please feel free to try online QR code generator to make your own QR codes.

Maybe you like to read the news on your e-reader and want clean sites for doing so?
