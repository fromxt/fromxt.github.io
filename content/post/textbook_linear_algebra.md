Linear Algebra is not what it seems at first thought. Behind all the matrices, polynomials, vectors and spaces, there is a fascinating subject which tools can help you to solve many practical problems. I want to recommend some intuitively clear linear algebra textbooks for self-taught.

1. **Immersive linear algebra** - http://immersivemath.com/ila/index.html  Immersive Math was developed over the span of three years by a three-man team with academic backgrounds in mathematics, computer graphics, and image coding.  The team, who worked on the project on a sporadic basis, used HTML5, JavaScript, and MathJax, an open-source library used to display mathematical notations. Additionally, they also developed their own engine for the interactive illustrations that pepper the free e-book, and say that they “could add” WebGL to Immersive Math in the indeterminate future.
