- Immersive linear algebra - http://immersivemath.com/ila/index.html  

   Immersive Math was developed over the span of three years by a three-man team with academic backgrounds in mathematics, computer graphics, and image coding.  The team, who worked on the project on a sporadic basis, used HTML5, JavaScript, and MathJax, an open-source library used to display mathematical notations.
