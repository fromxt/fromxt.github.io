Today is  Saturday, December 21, The winter solstice is almost upon us, which is the shortest day of 2019 for anyone living in the Northern Hemisphere.

When the sun rose on the morning after the shortest day, I wanted it to feel really joyous,I wanted a sublime sunrise and a blue sky and it to feel like a new day and a new dawning.
