This is excellent. Why don't teachers show this in school? It's so much easier to understand Sine, Cosine and Tangent this way! If i saw this 30 years ago high school maths would have been much easier!

The unit circle is a parametric graph of sine and cosine. It’s beauty is that it shows the relationship between circles and triangles. It also shows that if you have a right triangle of hypotenuse 1 and draw the triangle with the hypotenuse radially, then the vertical leg of the triangle is the same as the sine of the angle between the positive x axis and the hypotenuse. The length of the horizontal leg is the same as the cosine of that angle. This means that when we start working with larger circles, we can just scale each side up by a factor of the radius (so vertical leg becomes rsin(θ) and the horizontal leg becomes rcos(θ)). This is a key insight to deriving what are known as polar coordinates, which is taking our standard Cartesian coordinates and changing each point into terms of the distance from the origin and the angle made with the positive x axis. Extending this in three dimensions, you get spherical and cylindrical coordinates. These coordinate systems are super important in solving certain problems that rely on symmetry (the first one a calc student will probably be shown is finding the area of a circle or sphere using integration. It is rather difficult to approach these problems in Cartesian coordinates, but it becomes almost trivial in polar or spherical coordinates). Less abstractly, these coordinate systems are also useful in physics, one of the key uses being when you are calculating the electric field from a distribution, there are ways to exploit the symmetry of a system to make calculations easier.
