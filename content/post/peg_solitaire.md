[Peg Solitaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire) is a game in which you need to remove every piece of pegs from the board except one. To remove a ball, you must jump over it with another one. A valid move is to jump a peg over an adjacent peg into a hole two positions away and then to remove the jumped peg. Only vertical or horizontal movement is allowed in most board types. Diagonal movement is allowed only in the Triagular board. This may sound easy, but without a good strategy, you will get stuck sooner or later.
