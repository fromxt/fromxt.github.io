As many of you have probably seen, Firefox launched their encrypted file sharing system, However the service is discontinued right now, I'll share your curated sharing tools which have a client-side encryption feature.You can find a similar service hosted by structures in which we have trust by going to the following sites:
<!--more-->

- [Chapril](https://drop.chapril.org/) üëç

   An instance of [Send](https://github.com/mozilla/send), Encrypt and send files with a link that automatically expires.

- Public instances of [Lufi](https://github.com/ldidry/lufi)

- [Disroot (2 GB limit)](https://upload.disroot.org/)

- [Framadrop (3 GB limit)](https://framadrop.org/lufi/)

- [Infini (1 GB limit)](https://drop.infini.fr/)

- [Filepizza](https://file.pizza/)

   It‚Äôs also worth noting that FilePizza is a useful utility if you are frequently having to transfer large files. The application does not set a restriction on the maximum file    size, like other file-sharing apps or tools. This gives you a chance to share very large files that one or even multiple recipients can download.

- [Swisstransfer](https://www.swisstransfer.com/)

   Send up to 50 GB,Free and no registration required,Files stored in Switzerland,Keep your transfers for up to 30 d.

- [SendGB](https://www.sendgb.com/) 

   Send files up to 20GB,No sign up required,Unlimited downloads,This feature is only available in SendGB.

- [Hat.sh](https://hat.sh/) (no limit since files aren't uploaded to a server) 

   It's a js to en/decrypt files localy but not to send them,so you'll have to find another way to send them, but they'd be client-side encrypted. The other person would use it    as well to decrypt the file,which is to say you can use any cloud storage to share the file.

- [Filetransfer](https://filetransfer.io/)

    WeTransfer is the simplest way to send your files around the world. Share large files up to 2GB for free.

At last,You can self host [Send](https://github.com/mozilla/send),which is all open source.
