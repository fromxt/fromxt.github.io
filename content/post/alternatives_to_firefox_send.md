As many of you have probably seen, Firefox launched their encrypted file sharing system, However the service is discontinued right now, I'll share your curated sharing tools which have a client-side encryption feature.
<!--more-->

1. [Hat.sh](https://hat.sh/) (no limit since files aren't uploaded to a server) 

It's a js to en/decrypt files localy but not to send them,so you'll have to find another way to send them, but they'd be client-side encrypted. The other person would use it as well to decrypt the file, which is to say you can use any cloud storage to share the file.

2. Public instances of [Lufi](https://github.com/ldidry/lufi)

3. [Disroot (2 GB limit)](https://upload.disroot.org/)

4. [Framadrop (3 GB limit)](https://framadrop.org/lufi/)

5. [Infini (1 GB limit)](https://drop.infini.fr/)

6. [Filepizza](https://file.pizza/)

Itâ€™s also worth noting that FilePizza is a useful utility if you are frequently having to transfer large files. The application does not set a restriction on the maximum file size, like other file-sharing apps or tools. This gives you a chance to share very large files that one or even multiple recipients can download.
