How do I play?
You can play [Wordle online](https://opensourcewordle.com/), either on a computer or mobile device, right here.

Start by inputting a five-letter word and hitting enter.

The letters will then either turn green, yellow or stay blank.

Here’s what those colours mean:

1. Green – you have put the right letter in the right spot

2. Yellow – the letter is in the word, but in a different spot

3. Blank – the letter is not in the word
You can use your previous guesses to inform you next guess, and attempt to guess the word within six attempts.

Once you have finished the game will give you the option to share your score on social media.
