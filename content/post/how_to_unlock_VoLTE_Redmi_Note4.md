As we know, Redmi Note 4X (Snapdragon 625) actually supports three major Chinese carriers, China Mobile (CMCC), China Telecom(CT), and China Unicom(CU) VoLTE and Video Calling, but only CMCC is enabled in carrier config of MIUI offical ROM.Therefore, I would like to share how to  unlock VoLTE for CT and CU without root. First, it's necessary to update Redmi Note 4X with the latest version [V11.0.2.0.NCFMIXM](https://xiaomirom.com/en/rom/redmi-note-4-mido-global-fastboot-recovery-rom/).

5. Reboot the device.

   The "**HD**" symbol on top of a phone screen typically indicates that the device is unlocked to VoLTE.
