Today is a most-glorious, super rare palindrome day.What makes this palindrome day so rare is that it works globally â€“ as in, for Americans who write `MMDDYYYY`, as well as for other places that write `DDMMYYYY`. It also works for `YYYYMMDD`. A universal palindrome like this will be the only one this century!The last eight-digit palindrome like this was `11/11/1111`, 909 years ago. The next one is closer; just 101 years away, on `12/12/2121`. After that, it will be a long haul to `03/03/3030`.

So, this should probably be called "Universal Palindrome Day" because it is a palindrome irrespective of the endianness (big, little, or middle) that is used in various countries.

Here is the list of all such dates until the year 9999:

 - 0101-10-10

 - 1010-01-01
 
 - 1111-11-11
 
 - 2020-02-02
 
 - 2121-12-12
 
 - 3030-03-03
 
 - 4040-04-04
 
 - 5050-05-05
 
 - 6060-06-06
 
 - 7070-07-07
 
 - 8080-08-08
 
 - 9090-09-09

The Human Palindrome will be born today and die on `2121-12-12` at the age of 101. And in true palindromic fashion, his life will start and end with diapers.
