When a kid, you just sort of took for granted that stuff got better every year,However,when became an adult, You realized that the future is not guaranteed to be better. The default is that things stay the same even get worse because we continue to create new problems. The thing only gets better if you only committed with work hard.No matter how hard in the past 2024, you can always begin again. May your 2025 begin afresh with positive mindset, good health.
