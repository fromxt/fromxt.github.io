"A Visit from St. Nicholas", more commonly known as "The Night Before Christmas" and "'Twas the Night Before Christmas" from its first line, is a poem first published anonymously in 1823 and later attributed to Clement Clarke Moore, who claimed authorship in 1837. Some commentators now believe the poem was written by Henry Livingston Jr..

The poem has been called "arguably the best-known verses ever written by an American" and is largely responsible for some of the conceptions of Santa Claus from the mid-nineteenth century to today. It has had a massive impact on the history of Christmas gift-giving. Before the poem gained wide popularity, American ideas had varied considerably about Saint Nicholas and other Christmastide visitors. "A Visit from St. Nicholas" eventually was set to music and has been recorded by many artists.

## 'Twas the Night Before Christmas

_'Twas the night before Christmas, when all thro' the house_

_Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;_

_The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,_

_In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;_

_The children were nestled all snug in their beds,_

_While visions of sugar plums danced in their heads_

_And Mama in her kerchief, and I in my cap,_

_Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap‍—‌_

_When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,_

_I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter._

_ Away to the window I flew like a flash, _

_Tore open the shutters, and threw up the sash._

_The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow,_

_Gave the luster of mid-day to objects below;_

_When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,_

_But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,_

_With a little old driver, so lively and quick,_

_I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick._

_More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,_

_And he whistled, and shouted, and call'd them by name:_

_**"Now! Dasher, now! Dancer, now! Prancer and Vixen,**_

_**"On! Comet, on! Cupid, on! Dunder and Blixem;**_

_"To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall!_

_"Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!"_

_As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,_

_When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;_

_So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,_

_With the sleigh full of toys‍—‌and St. Nicholas too:_

_And then in a twinkling, I heard on the roof_

_The prancing and pawing of each little hoof._

_As I drew in my head, and was turning around,_

_Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound:_

_He was dress'd all in fur, from his head to his foot,_

_And his clothes were all tarnish'd with ashes and soot;_

_A bundle of toys was flung on his back,_

_And he look'd like a peddler just opening his pack:_

_His eyes‍—‌how they twinkled! His dimples: how merry,_

_His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry;_

_His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,_

_And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;_

_The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,_

_And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath._

_He had a broad face, and a little round belly_

_That shook when he laugh'd, like a bowl full of jelly:_

_He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,_

_And I laugh'd when I saw him in spite of myself;_

_A wink of his eye and a twist of his head_

_Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread._

_He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,_

_And fill'd all the stockings; then turn'd with a jerk,_

_And laying his finger aside of his nose_

_And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose._

_He sprung to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,_

_And away they all flew, like the down of a thistle:_

_But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight‍—‌_

_Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night_
