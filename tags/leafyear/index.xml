It comes up on the calendar only every four years. A year with a February 29 might be good news if you are paid by the day or the week. But it might be bad news if you were born on a February 29. You have to wait three years in between birthdays.
In any case, American English has a term for the unusual situation.</description></item></channel></rss>
