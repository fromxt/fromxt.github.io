It comes up on the calendar only every four years. A year with a February 29 might be <a href=https://www.paleyrothman.com/print/legal-blog/the-payroll-leap-year-what-it-is-and-what-to-do-about-it>good news</a> if you are paid by the day or the week. But it might be bad news if you were born on a February 29. You have to wait three years in between birthdays.</p><p>In any case, American English has a term for the unusual situation. February 29 is called a leap day. And the entire 12 month period with a February 29 in it is called a leap year. This year, 2020, is such a year.</p><p>The word
The word &ldquo;leap&rdquo; describes the jumping action of a frog, like this one.
As a verb, the word &ldquo;leap&rdquo; means to jump, or to move quickly. &ldquo;Leap&rdquo; can also be a noun, meaning a jump, or a sudden move.</p><p>In a leap year, the dates jump over one day of the week. Let me explain. In 2017, the last day of the year, December 31, fell on a Sunday. In 2018, it fell on a Monday. In 2019, it fell on a Tuesday. But in 2020, December 31 will fall on a Thursday. It just leaped right over Wednesday.</p><p>The reason for a leap day or a leap year is because our calendar does not follow the Earth&rsquo;s orbit around the sun exactly. Each year, we have a little time left over. So every four years, we put all that time together into an extra day – or, what is officially called an intercalary day. But I have never, ever heard an English speaker use that term. &ldquo;Leap day&rdquo; is fine.</p><p>&ldquo;Leap&rdquo; is also an important word for two other common – but opposing – American expressions. One is a kind of warning. If you want someone to investigate a situation completely before taking action, you might say, &ldquo;Look before you leap.&rdquo;</p><p>The other expression is a phrase of hope. Urging someone to &ldquo;take a leap of faith&rdquo; invites the person to take action, even if not everything about a situation is known.</p><p>Interestingly, both phrases are completely reasonable to say to someone who is about to get married.</p><p>On that note, some people choose to marry on February 29 because it is an unusual date. One wedding chapel in the U.S. city of Las Vegas is even offering a free ceremony for those who decide to &ldquo;take the leap&rdquo; into marriage on the last day of this month. The ceremony is followed by a chance to skydive together – that is, jump out of an airplane with a parachute.</p><p>But some ancient peoples would likely tell couples not to do it. Leap years were believed to be difficult, and leap days unlucky and a bad time to begin anything new.</p><p>Whatever you think about them, the change in the calendar will be gone soon enough. Then we can return to normal, and leap over February 29 as usual.</p><h2 id=refrence>Refrence</h2><ul><li><a href=https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/why-is-2020-called-a-leap-year-/5284218.html>https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/why-is-2020-called-a-leap-year-/5284218.html</a></li></ul></div><div class=post-copyright><p class=copyright-item><span class=item-title>Author</span>
